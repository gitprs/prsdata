            I would like to introduce you to my friend who is the new COO for CWO here in GJ.  CWO is the other large independent practice in the valley and they are also on Allscripts.<br><br>
             
            He is looking for some potential billing help as he is evaluating each of the departments in their practice.  We discussed how valuable the guidance and expertise you both have provided in our quest to renovate our revenue cycle has been.<br><br>
             
            He is copied on this email, as well.<br><br>
